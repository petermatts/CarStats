1.0 Design and TODO

- Phase 1 Set Up & Design : Done

- Phase 2 Modifications/Revisions
    - Redo Scraper - 2.0 (git issue #31)
        - itteration of years, models, trims
        - revise how scraper gets vehicle trim
        - keep a log of last scraped vehicle button indexes (make sure their order is consistent)
            - this will make scrapping easier if errors occur.
            - keep logs in yaml/json format containing indecies and corresponding text values
            - (git issue #34)
    - conversion scripts (git issue #33)
        - yaml -> csv
        - yaml -> json?
        - json -> csv?
    - new correction scripts (git issue #35)
    - Redo/revise link acquisition and correction scripts
    - Update documentation (git issue #36)

- Phase 3 Display
    - use python sys module to allow command line args running scripts that alter/write data: git issue #29
        - commented out sys import in many of the src scripts where this would be handy
    - Find way of displaying/comparing/filtering/sorting resulting data
        - Explore using matplotlib.pyplot to display specs
            - further explore interactability so that data rows can be sorted according to desired features
        - html or react?
    - Add 'custom' specs/stats like: git issue #23
        - hp/ton
    - potential more generic idea: allow for manual additions in general
