1.0 Design and TODO

- Phase 1 Set Up & Design : Done

- Phase 2 Modifications/Revisions
    - merge branch Scraper-v2.0 into main branch
    - new correction scripts (git issue #35)
    - more specific options for scraping (git issue #43):
        - scrape latest year
        - scrape all of a specific model
        - both
    - more options for data conversion (git issue #45)

- Phase 3 Display
    - use python sys module to allow command line args running scripts that alter/write data: git issue #29
        - commented out sys import in many of the src scripts where this would be handy
    - Find way of displaying/comparing/filtering/sorting resulting data
        - Explore using matplotlib.pyplot to display specs
            - further explore interactability so that data rows can be sorted according to desired features
        - html or react?
    - Add 'custom' specs/stats like: git issue #23
        - hp/ton
    - potential more generic idea: allow for manual additions in general
