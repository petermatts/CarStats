    - Error Link Handling
        - Find links in csvs that do not end with regex '\d{6}$' as well
    - CSV correction script
    - CSV compilation script

- Phase 3 Display
    - Find way of displaying/comparing/filtering/sorting resulting data
        - Explore using matplotlib.pyplot to display specs
            - further explore interactability so that data rows can be sorted according to desired features
        - html or react?
    - Add 'custom' specs/stats like:
