1.0 Design and TODO

- Phase 1 Set Up & Design : Done

- Phase 2 Modifications/Revisions
    - CSV correction script(s) git issue #21
        - in progress
    - scrape widths? git issue #28

- Phase 3 Display
    - use python sys module to allow command line args running scripts that alter/write data: git issue #29
        - commented out sys import in many of the src scripts where this would be handy
    - Find way of displaying/comparing/filtering/sorting resulting data
        - Explore using matplotlib.pyplot to display specs
            - further explore interactability so that data rows can be sorted according to desired features
        - html or react?
    - Add 'custom' specs/stats like: git issue #23
        - hp/ton
