- Phase 1
    - RUN script to compile data into csvs for all brands/all models across years available/everything
    - move source code to an src folder
        - get everything working first
            - still some tweeks to scraper that are trickling in
    - test Targets.py in src and add implicitly_wait in Targets.py
    - test SummaryGenerator.py in src

- Phase 2
    - Find way of displaying/comparing/filtering/sorting resulting data
        - Explore using matplotlib.pyplot to display specs
            - further explore interactability so that data rows can be sorted according to desired features
        - html or react?
    - Add 'custom' specs/stats like:
        - hp/ton
