- Phase 1
    - Modify link scraper: 
        - write resulting data to csv files in /Links/{Brand}/{Year}/{Model}.csv
        - finish data scraper/parser
        - make data scraper 'iterate' through all trims of all models of all brands
            - fully expecting this operation to have a long runtime
                - because of server requests and stuff like that
                - but atleast it will be a one time operation...
                    - assuming no issues and I dont change my mind on output format after...
        - remove old scraper (URLs.py)

    - move source code to an src folder
        - get everything working first

- Phase 2
    - Find way of displaying/comparing/filtering/sorting resulting data
        - Explore using matplotlib.pyplot to display specs
            - further explore interactability so that data rows can be sorted according to desired features
