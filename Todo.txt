1.0 Design and TODO

- Phase 1 Set Up & Design : Done

- Phase 2 Modifications/Revisions
    - convert CLI-like files to use the argparser python package (git issue #66)
    - Verify and test the updated scrape (for pulling latest specs by year, model, etc. and not everything)
    - More corrections as needed (this can probably be moved to Phase 3)

- Phase 3 Display (git issue #32)
    - Find way of displaying/comparing/filtering/sorting resulting data
        - html (best bet)
        - react?
        - Explore using matplotlib.pyplot to display specs
            - further explore interactability so that data rows can be sorted according to desired features
    - Add 'custom' specs/stats like: (git issue #23)
        - hp/ton
    - potential more generic idea: allow for manual additions in general, like user notes on a car if they are car shopping
