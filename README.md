# CarStats

## About

This project aims to compile a list of key statistics across all common car models and brands, for ease of comparison for a user.

It does this via webscrapping the reliable [https://caranddriver.com](https://caranddriver.com).

### Progress/Construction

Using python's `selenium` module this project is able to webscrape all brands and their models.

The processes of extracting the information from each cars' specs page is currently in construction.

A method to 'iteratively' scrape all models (with variants over all years that model is available) for each brand is currently on the docket to be done.

Ideally once all data is collected it should be displayed properly, most likely in a table.

## Specs

Graphic of all specs being taken into consideration **coming soon** or see `Base.txt` or `Base.csv` in the `Docs` folder.
