### /src/Corrections

This folder will contain all brand individual ccorrections scripts which will be imported to `src/Corrections.py` to run corrections on the data. 

All correction functions should take in a list of lines of the data csv file and return al lines of the file with the corrections.

**Note** these scripts work with the version of the scraper as of 4/2/202.
Changing/optimizing the scrapper may change the output of the scrapper, be sure to back up the Data folder before making changes/corrections.
