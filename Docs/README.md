# Documentation/Important Docs

This folder contains the documentation for which the design of this project is based on. Notes and designs and all that jazz.

## Files

### Base

`Base.csv` serves as the base header for the CSV files in the `Data` folder. It is essentially a list of all attributes/specs stored.

`Base.txt` is used to make `Base.csv` and is generated by parsing all data for all specs attribute names.

### Status files

`HistoryScrapeStatus.xlsx` is used to track which brands have gotten webscraped and have up to date information.

### Testing

`regex_testing.txt` is used for regular expression testing when parsing data.

### Useful reference links

`UsefulLinks.txt` has some cool/helpful links

### All Links

`AllLinks.txt` is a compilation of all base form links for scraping (some may not be accurate), an issue that is handled elsewhere in the scraping process
